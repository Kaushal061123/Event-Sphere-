**Event Sphere is an event management application designed to simplify task organization and scheduling.**
Users can seamlessly add, edit, and delete tasks, all within a user-friendly graphical interface.
Key Features:
**Task Management:** Users can create tasks associated with specific dates. Whether itâ€™s a meeting, deadline, or personal event, they can easily input and manage their tasks.
**Recurring Tasks:** The app supports recurring tasks, allowing users to set up events that repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or at custom intervals.
**Interactive UI:** The graphical interface built with Tkinter provides an intuitive experience for users to navigate and interact with their tasks.
Underlying Technology:
**SQLite Database:** Event Sphere utilizes SQLite for efficient storage and retrieval of task data. SQLite is lightweight, making it ideal for local applications.
Tkinter: As a Python library, Tkinter enables the creation of graphical user interfaces. Its simplicity and cross-platform compatibility make it a popular choice for desktop applications.
Potential Enhancements:
Consider adding features like notifications (reminders), color-coded labels for different task types, and the ability to categorize tasks.
Implement data synchronization across devices (if applicable) to enhance user convenience.
Challenges and Learnings:
Developing a responsive UI that caters to various screen sizes and resolutions.
Ensuring data consistency and handling edge cases (e.g., overlapping tasks, unexpected shutdowns).
